// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your
// prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
// evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 
//tests evaluate to False.
// Tests for equality and inequality with strings
var my_name = 'saba';
var your_name = 'sana';
console.log(my_name.length == 4);
console.log(3 * 4 == 6);
console.log(2 == 2);
console.log(my_name.length > 5);
console.log(4 > 5);
console.log('saba' != 'saba');
console.log((5 + 6) == 7);
